## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-06

### Added

#### Core Functionality
- **Split operation** for downsampling high-resolution images with intelligent aspect ratio preservation
- **Split-with-processed operation** for calculating delta images from processed results
- **Merge operation** for applying deltas back to original high-resolution images with sub-pixel precision
- **Batch processing** support for handling multiple images efficiently

#### Delta Encoding System
- **Mid-gray delta encoding** (RGB 127,127,127 as neutral) for mathematically precise change representation
- **Refined delta support** for extreme precision requirements (±255 per channel combined)
- **16-bit internal arithmetic** to prevent quantization errors during processing
- **Lossless PNG storage** for delta images to preserve every bit of precision

#### Image Processing Features
- **Multi-format support**: PNG, JPEG, WebP, TIFF, BMP input formats
- **Fallback image loading**: PIL → OpenCV automatic fallback for robust file handling
- **High-quality downsampling**: Lanczos filtering to prevent aliasing artifacts
- **Intelligent padding**: Center-aligned black padding for aspect ratio mismatches
- **Metadata preservation**: Automatic tracking of processing parameters for reconstruction

#### Advanced Upscaling
- **Basic upscaling**: High-quality Lanczos interpolation built-in
- **External upscaler integration**: cmd() syntax for AI tools (Real-ESRGAN, waifu2x, etc.)
- **Progress indicators**: Automatic progress bars for large image operations
- **Hybrid upscaling**: Different methods for main vs refined deltas

#### Dimension Handling
- **Pixel dimensions**: Direct specification (e.g., 512, 1024)
- **Percentage dimensions**: Relative scaling (e.g., "50%", "25%")
- **Aspect ratio preservation**: Automatic calculation with padding as needed
- **Scale validation**: Comprehensive dimension checking and error handling

#### User Experience
- **Fire CLI framework**: Intuitive command-line interface with automatic help generation
- **Verbose logging**: Structured logging with configurable detail levels
- **Rich terminal output**: Beautiful progress indicators and error messages
- **Comprehensive validation**: Early error detection with helpful guidance

#### Resource Management
- **Disk space checking**: Preemptive validation with 2× safety factor
- **Memory optimization**: Automatic handling for large images
- **Temporary file cleanup**: Automatic cleanup even on operation failure
- **Error recovery**: Multiple fallback strategies for robust operation

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- **607 lines of Python code** with comprehensive functionality
- **16 core methods** including processing, validation, and utility functions
- **Modern Python 3.12+** with complete type hints throughout
- **Modular design** with clean separation of concerns

#### Dependencies
- **fire**: CLI framework for intuitive command-line interface
- **rich**: Beautiful terminal output with progress bars
- **pillow**: Primary image processing library
- **numpy**: High-performance numerical operations
- **loguru**: Advanced logging with structured output
- **opencv-python**: Fallback image loading and specialized operations

#### Quality Assurance
- **PEP 8 compliance**: Automated formatting with ruff
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Type safety**: Complete type annotations for better maintainability
- **Documentation**: Extensive docstrings and inline comments

### Documentation

#### Comprehensive Documentation Package
- **README.md**: 690+ lines of detailed documentation covering all aspects
- **SPEC.md**: Complete technical specification of implementation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-specific coding guidelines and standards
- **Usage examples**: Real-world workflows and troubleshooting guides
- **API documentation**: Complete command reference with examples

#### Test Utilities
- **create_test_image.py**: Gradient test image generation for validation
- **simulate_processing.py**: Model processing simulation for testing workflows

### Performance Characteristics

#### Memory Usage
- **4K images**: ~25MB peak memory usage, 1-5 second processing
- **8K images**: ~100MB peak memory usage, 5-30 second processing
- **Optimization**: Automatic progress bars for operations >2000×2000 pixels

#### Processing Speed
- **Delta calculation**: 0.1-2 seconds for typical operations
- **Basic upscaling**: 0.5-5 seconds depending on scale factor
- **External upscaling**: 10-300 seconds (tool-dependent)
- **Batch efficiency**: Optimized memory reuse across operations

### Known Limitations

- **RGB only**: Alpha channels are converted to RGB (transparency not preserved)
- **8-bit precision**: Without refinement, limited to ±127 per channel changes
- **External tool dependency**: cmd() upscaling requires external tools to be installed
