## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Core Image Processing Components

1. Color Transformation Engine (old/imgrepalette)
- Specialized palette mapping system using perceptual color spaces
- Multiple recoloring algorithms: fast mapping, interpolation, dithering
- Luminance preservation modes with custom HSV weighting
- Intelligent palette expansion through color interpolation
Importance: 95

2. Visual Similarity Processing (old/imgsort*)
- Image sequencing based on visual content analysis
- Brightness-based initial ordering with darkest image anchor point
- Progressive chain building using nearest-neighbor visual matching
- Multiple optimization approaches for similarity calculation
Importance: 90

3. Layer Management System (old/imgs2layers*)
- Professional PSD composition with precise layer control
- Flexible canvas sizing strategies (first/min/max/custom)
- Advanced positioning system with center/corner alignment
- Opacity and offset management with collision handling
Importance: 85

4. Delta-Based Resolution Bridge (old/imgproxyproc)
- Two-phase processing for high-resolution image handling
- Custom delta encoding using mid-gray baseline
- Dual-delta precision system for refined detail preservation
- Intelligent dimension management with aspect preservation
Importance: 90

5. Image Matching and Renaming (old/imgrenmatch)
- Visual similarity-based file organization
- MSE-driven image comparison with standardized processing
- Intelligent collision handling for duplicate matches
- Format-aware naming preservation
Importance: 80

6. Specialized Transformation Tools
- Aspect ratio optimization (old/imgratio)
- Grayscale conversion with alpha channel integration (old/imgany2gray)
- Color transfer between images (old/imgcolortransfer)
- Intelligent cropping and canvas manipulation (old/imgrecanvas)
Importance: 75

The system architecture emphasizes modular image processing with specialized components handling distinct aspects of visual content manipulation. Each component implements domain-specific algorithms focused on professional image processing requirements while maintaining format compatibility and quality preservation.
