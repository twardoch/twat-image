Core color processing algorithms for image recoloring and palette mapping:

## Color Space Transformations (Importance: 95)
- Perceptual color space (CIELAB) conversions for accurate color matching
- Custom HSV-based color transformations with luminance preservation
- Intelligent hue wraparound handling during interpolation
- Color profile preservation during transformations
Implemented in: `old/imgrepalette`

## Palette Mapping Methods (Importance: 90)
- Fast nearest-neighbor mapping using KD-trees in CIELAB space
- Interpolated mapping with expanded palette colors
- Floyd-Steinberg dithering for gradient preservation
- Smooth luminance-preserving recoloring
Implemented in: `old/imgrepalette`

## Color Matching Logic (Importance: 85)
- 70% weight for hue matching
- 30% weight for saturation matching  
- Intelligent luminance preservation during color transformations
- Perceptual distance calculations in Lab color space
Implemented in: `old/imgrepalette`, `old/imgrepalette copy`

## Palette Management (Importance: 80)
- Minimum 3 distinct colors required in RRGGBB format
- Palette expansion through color interpolation
- Hue-based sorting for smooth transitions
- Dynamic palette generation from interpolated colors
Implemented in: `old/imgrepalette`

## Color Preservation Rules (Importance: 75)
- Original luminance preservation in two modes (fast/interpolated)
- Color fidelity maintenance through perceptual space operations
- Gradient preservation using dithering algorithms
- Structure preservation during color transformations
Implemented in: `old/imgrepalette`, `old/imgrepalette copy`
