# delta-processing-system

The delta-processing-system implements a two-phase image transformation workflow to handle high-resolution images through resolution-limited models while preserving quality:

### Core Delta Processing Pipeline
- Split phase downsamples input while preserving aspect ratios and storing reconstruction metadata
- Process phase performs transformations on downsampled version 
- Merge phase reconstructs high-resolution output using stored deltas and metadata

### Delta Calculation Engine
- Uses mid-gray (RGB 127,127,127) as neutral baseline for encoding changes
- Positive deltas stored as brighter values
- Negative deltas stored as darker values
- Two-stage precision system:
  - Main delta captures primary transformations (±127 range)
  - Refined delta captures subtle details (additional ±127 range)
  - Combined precision provides full ±255 range per channel

### Quality Preservation System
- All delta calculations performed in 16-bit color depth
- Intelligent padding system maintains aspect ratios during downsampling
- Precise metadata tracking ensures pixel-perfect reconstruction
- Optional refined delta pass captures residual differences

### Delta Application Logic
- Upscales processed content to match original resolution
- Removes padding based on stored metadata
- Applies main and refined deltas using 16-bit arithmetic
- Handles edge cases for extreme aspect ratios
