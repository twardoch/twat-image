# image-similarity-algorithms

## Core Image Similarity Engine (Importance: 95)
- MSE-based visual similarity calculation using downsampled image comparisons
- Custom distance matrix computation for efficient pairwise image matching
- Perceptual color space transformations for human-vision aligned matching
- Vectorized parallel processing for large image set comparisons

## Visual Sequence Optimization (Importance: 90) 
- Nearest-neighbor path finding to create visually coherent image sequences
- Progressive brightness-based sequencing from darkest to lightest images
- Optimization algorithms for minimizing visual discontinuity between adjacent images
- Maintains visual flow while preventing sequence fragmentation

## Matching Strategy System (Importance: 85)
- Reference-based image matching for consistent naming/grouping
- Collision resolution through incremental suffixing
- Format-aware processing supporting PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP, GIF
- Preservation of visual relationships in final naming/ordering
