# About this project

`image-alpha-utils` is a Python utility for converting images to include alpha channels based on grayscale values, and other image manipulations. It provides:

- Library functions for programmatic image processing.
- A command-line interface (`imagealpha`) for direct use.
- Functionality to normalize grayscale images and create alpha masks.
- Color parsing for flexible color specifications.
- Support for reading from and writing to files or stdin/stdout.

## Development Notes
- Uses `uv` and `hatch` for Python package and project management.
- Quality tools: `ruff` (linting/formatting), `mypy` (type checking), `pytest` (testing).
- Follows modern Python packaging standards (PEP 621).
- Strong typing and clear API design are emphasized.
