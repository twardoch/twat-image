# such that values above the 90th percentile of brightness become white, then the formula
# `white_point_threshold = white_point_percentage / 100.0` would be correct.
# The current formula `1.0 - (white_point_percentage / 100.0)` means if you pass `white_point=10` (%),
# the threshold becomes `0.9`. This is like saying "the top 10% of the brightness range is considered white".
# If you pass `white_point=90` (%), threshold becomes `0.1`. This is like "the top 90% of the brightness range is white".
# The latter interpretation seems more consistent with how `black_point` percentage is handled
# (`black_point=10` (%) means threshold `0.1`, i.e., "bottom 10% is black").
# If this interpretation is correct, then the docstring "Above this threshold the pixel becomes white"
# combined with `white_point = (1 - white_point / 100)` for percentages is confusing.
# However, tests should reflect the code as written.
# The current default `white_point=0.9` (fractional) means "values >= 0.9 are white".
# The default `black_point=0.1` (fractional) means "values <= 0.1 are black".
# This seems to be the primary way it's intended to be used.
# The percentage conversion for white_point might indeed be a bug or a misunderstanding of its intent.
# I've added a test `test_normalize_percentage_thresholds` that passes with current logic.
# If the logic for `white_point` percentage is "fixed" later, that test would need adjustment.
# For now, the test `test_normalize_custom_thresholds` uses fractional points and should be robust.
