The error occurs because you're running the script without any arguments, but you have `set -u` enabled which treats unset variables as errors.

Let me fix this by adding argument validation:

---

```diff
  
  set -euo pipefail
+ 
+ if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
+     echo "Error: Missing input file"
+     echo "Usage: $(basename "$0") input.png [output.png]"
+     exit 1
+ fi
  
  input="$1"
```

---

Now the script will check if any arguments were provided before trying to use them. If you run the script without arguments, it will show a helpful error message and exit gracefully instead of failing with the "unbound variable" error.
